[The first lesson](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/tutorial/getting-started-with-xcode-playgrounds-0afee09b-0bdb-47bd-8551-e179266b6b65/get-started-with-xcode-74d7476e-22f1-403c-99ab-b767f1a7b71e) has been updated with instructions for checking your version and updating if necessary.

Let's get some more practice with _optionals_ and learn about a new data type -- _dictionaries_!. In this _Swift Playground_, you will learn how to store, read, and update key-value pairs in dictionaries. You'll also get a lot of optionals practice along the way!
